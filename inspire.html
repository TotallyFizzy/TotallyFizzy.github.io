<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
<p>Over the last 100 years no one exemplifies these values for me more than Thomas Edison. It is said that humans are subject to mother nature, and can't do anything to fight it. Edison proved this wrong with his light bulb, conquering the night.</p>
