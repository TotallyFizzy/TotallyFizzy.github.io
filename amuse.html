   <h1> Websites that amuse me </h1>
   <p>There are many funny pages on the web, 3 that stick out are:</p>
    <h2> Bouncing Cats Page</h2>
   <p><a href = "https://cat-bounce.com/" > This page</a>, where you fling cats around, is very amusing.</p>
   <h2> The Useless Web</h2>
   <p><a href = "https://theuselessweb.com/" > This page</a>, which can take you to many random, weird, amusing webpages.</p>
   <h2> The Onion</h2>
   <p><a href = "https://theonion.com/" > This "news site"</a>, full of many funny, fake news articles.</p>
